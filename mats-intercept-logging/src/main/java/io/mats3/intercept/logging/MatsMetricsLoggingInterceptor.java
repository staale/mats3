/**
 * A logging interceptor that writes loglines to two SLF4J loggers, including multiple pieces of information on the MDC
 * (initiatorId, endpointId and stageIds, and timings and sizes), so that it hopefully is easy to reason about and debug
 * all Mats flows, and to be able to use the logging system (e.g. Kibana over ElasticSearch) to create statistics.
 * <p />
 * Two loggers are used, which are {@link #log_init "io.mats3.log.init"} and {@link #log_stage "io.mats3.log.stage"}.
 * All loglines' message-part is prepended with <code>"#MATSLOG#"</code>.
 *
 * <h2>Log lines and their metadata</h2> There are 5 different type of log lines emitted by this logging interceptor -
 * but note that the "Per Message" log line can be combined with the "Initiate Complete" or "Stage Complete" loglines if
 * the initiation or stage only produce a single message - read more at end.
 * <ol>
 * <li>Initiate Complete</li>
 * <li>Message Received (on Stage)</li>
 * <li>Stage Complete</li>
 * <li>Per Created/Sent message (both for initiations and stage produced messages)</li>
 * <li>Metrics set from the user lambda during initiation and stages</li>
 * </ol>
 * Some MDC properties are set by the JMS implementation, and not by this interceptor. These are the ones that do not
 * have a JavaDoc-link in the below listings.
 * <p />
 * Note that all loglines that are emitted by any code, user or system, <i>which are within Mats init or processing</i>,
 * will have the follow properties set:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code><b>"mats.AppName"</b></code>: The app-name which the MatsFactory was created with</li>
 * <li><code><b>"mats.AppVersion"</b></code>: The app-version which the MatsFactory was created with</li>
 * <li>Either, or both, of <code><b>"mats.Init"</b></code> (set to 'true' on initiation enter, and cleared on exit) and
 * <code><b>"mats.Stage"</b></code> (set to constant 'true' for all Mats Stage processors). If initiation within a
 * stage, both are set.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 *
 * <h2>MDC Properties for Initiate Complete:</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_INITIATE_COMPLETED "mats.InitiateCompleted"}</b>: 'true' <i>on a single</i> logline per
 * completed initiation - <i>can be used to count initiations</i>. Assuming each initiation produces one message, and
 * hence one flow, this count should be identical to the count of {@link #MDC_MATS_FLOW_COMPLETED}. However, an
 * initiation can produce multiple messages, as described in {@link #MDC_MATS_COMPLETE_QUANTITY_OUT}, thus if you sum
 * all those of lines that have this property set, the value should actually be identical to flows completed.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_TRACE_ID "traceId"}</b>: Set for an initiation from when it is set in the user code performing the
 * initiation (reset to whatever it was upon exit of initiation lambda)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <b>Metrics for the execution of the initiation</b> (very similar to the metrics for a stage processing):
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_COMPLETE_TIME_TOTAL_EXECUTION "mats.exec.TotalExecution.ms"}</b>: Total time taken for the
 * initiation to complete - including both user code and all system code including commits.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_COMPLETE_TIME_USER_LAMBDA "mats.exec.UserLambda.ms"}</b>: Part of total time taken for the
 * actual user lambda, including e.g. any external IO like DB, but excluding all system code, in particular message
 * creation, and commits.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_COMPLETE_TIME_OUT "mats.exec.Out.ms"}</b>: Part of total time taken for the creation and
 * serialization of Mats messages, and production <i>and sending</i> of "message system messages" (e.g. creating and
 * populating JMS Message plus <code>jmsProducer.send(..)</code> for the JMS implementation)</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_COMPLETE_QUANTITY_OUT "mats.exec.Out.quantity"}</b>: Number of messages sent</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_COMPLETE_TIME_DB_COMMIT "mats.exec.DbCommit.ms"}</b>: Part of total time taken for committing
 * DB.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_COMPLETE_TIME_MSG_SYS_COMMIT "mats.exec.MsgSysCommit.ms"}</b>: Part of total time taken for
 * committing the message system (e.g. <code>jmsSession.commit()</code> for the JMS implementation)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <b>User metrics:</b> Furthermore, any metrics (measurements and timings) set from an initiation or stage will be
 * available as separate log lines, the metric being set on the MDC. The MDC key for timings will be
 * {@link #MDC_MATS_COMPLETE_OPS_TIMING_PREFIX "mats.exec.ops.time."}+{metricId}+"ms" and for measurements
 * {@link #MDC_MATS_COMPLETE_OPS_MEASURE_PREFIX "mats.exec.ops.measure."}+{metricId} + {baseUnit}. If labels/tags are
 * set on a metric, the MDC-key will be {@link #MDC_MATS_COMPLETE_OPS_TIMING_PREFIX
 * "mats.exec.ops.time."}+{metricId}+".tag." + {labelKey} and for measurements
 * {@link #MDC_MATS_COMPLETE_OPS_MEASURE_PREFIX "mats.exec.ops.measure."}+{metricId} + ".tag." + {labelKey}.<br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 *
 * <h2>MDC Properties for Message Received:</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_MESSAGE_RECEIVED "mats.MessageReceived"}</b>: 'true' on a single logline per received message
 * - <i>can be used to count received messages</i>. This count should be identical to the count of
 * {@link #MDC_MATS_STAGE_COMPLETED}.</li>
 * <li><code><b>"mats.StageId"</b></code>: Always set on the Processor threads for a stage, so any logline output inside
 * a Mats stage will have this set.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_TRACE_ID "traceId"}</b>: The Mats flow's traceId, set from the initiation.</li>
 * <li><code><b>"mats.in.MsgSysId"</b></code>: The messageId the messaging system assigned the message when it was
 * produced on the sender side (e.g JMSMessageID for the JMS implementation)</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_IN_MATS_MESSAGE_ID "mats.in.MatsMsgId"}</b>: The messageId the Mats system assigned the
 * message when it was produced on the sender side. Note that it consists of the Mats flow id + an individual part per
 * message in the flow.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_IN_FROM_APP_NAME "mats.in.from.App"}</b>: Which app this incoming message is from.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_IN_FROM_ID "mats.in.from.Id"}</b>: Which initiatorId, endpointId or stageId this message is
 * from.</li>
 * <li><i>NOTICE: NOT using <code>"mats.in.to.app"</code>, as that is "this" App, and thus identical to
 * <code>"mats.AppName"</code>.</i></li>
 * <li><i>NOTICE: NOT using <code>"mats.in.to.id"</code>, as that is "this" StageId, and thus identical to
 * <code>"mats.StageId"</code>.</i></li>
 * </ul>
 * Common for all received and sent messages in a Mats flow (initiated, received on stage and sent from stage):
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_INIT_APP "mats.init.App"}</b>: Which App initiated this Mats flow.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_INIT_ID "mats.init.Id"}</b>: The initiatorId of this MatsFlow;
 * <code>matsInitiate.from(initiatorId)</code>.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_AUDIT "mats.Audit"}</b>: Whether this Mats flow should be audited.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_INTERACTIVE "mats.Interactive"}</b>: Whether this Mats flow should be treated as
 * "interactive", meaning that a human is actively waiting for its execution.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_PERSISTENT "mats.Persistent"}</b>: Whether the messaging system should use persistent (as
 * opposed to non-persistent) message passing, i.e. store to disk to survive a crash.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <b>Metrics for message reception</b> (note how these compare to the production of a message, on the "Per Message"
 * loglines):
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_IN_TIME_SINCE_SENT "mats.in.SinceSent.ms"}</b>: Time taken from message was sent to it was
 * received. This metric gives the queue time, plus any other latency wrt. sending and committing on the sending side
 * and the transfer and reception on the receiving side.<b>This metric is susceptible to time skews between
 * nodes</b>.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_IN_TIME_SINCE_PRECEDING_ENDPOINT_STAGE "mats.in.PrecedEpStage.ms"}</b>: Time taken from the
 * sending of a message from the Stage immediately preceding this Stage <i>on the same Endpoint</i>, to the reception of
 * a message on this Stage, i.e. the time between stages of an Endpoint (but also between an Initiation REQUEST and the
 * replyTo-reception on the Terminator). This timing includes queue times and processing times of requested endpoints
 * happening in between the send and the receive, as well as any other latencies. For example, it is the time between
 * when EndpointA.Stage<b>2</b> performs a REQUEST to AnotherEndpointB, till the REPLY from that endpoint is received on
 * EndpointA.Stage<b>3</b> (There might be dozens of message passing and processings in between those two stages of the
 * same endpoint, as AnotherEndpointB might itself have a dozen stages, each performing some requests to yet other
 * endpoints). <b>This metric is susceptible to time skews between nodes</b>.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_IN_TIME_TOTAL_PREPROC_AND_DESERIAL "mats.in.TotalPreprocDeserial.ms"}</b>: Total time taken
 * to preprocess and deserialize the incoming message.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_IN_TIME_MSGSYS_DECONSTRUCT "mats.in.MsgSysDeconstruct.ms"}</b>: Part of total time taken to
 * pick out the Mats pieces from the incoming message system message.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_IN_SIZE_ENVELOPE_WIRE "mats.in.EnvelopeWire.bytes"}</b>: How big the incoming Mats envelope
 * ("MatsTrace") was in the incoming message system message, i.e. "on the wire".</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_IN_TIME_ENVELOPE_DECOMPRESS "mats.in.EnvelopeDecompress.ms"}</b>: Part of total time taken to
 * decompress the Mats envelope (will be 0 if it was sent plain, and >0 if it was compressed).</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_IN_SIZE_ENVELOPE_SERIAL "mats.in.EnvelopeSerial.bytes"}</b>: How big the incoming Mats
 * envelope ("MatsTrace") is in its serialized form, after decompression.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_IN_TIME_ENVELOPE_DESERIAL "mats.in.EnvelopeDeserial.ms"}</b>: Part of total time taken to
 * deserialize the incoming serialized Mats envelope.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_IN_TIME_MSG_AND_STATE_DESERIAL "mats.in.MsgAndStateDeserial.ms"}</b>: Part of total time
 * taken to deserialize the actual message and state objects from the Mats envelope.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 *
 * <h2>MDC Properties for Stage Complete:</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_STAGE_COMPLETED "mats.StageCompleted"}</b>: 'true' on a single logline per completed stage -
 * <i>can be used to count stage processings</i>. This count should be identical to the count of
 * {@link #MDC_MATS_MESSAGE_RECEIVED}.</li>
 * <li><code><b>"mats.StageId"</b></code>: Always set on the Processor threads for a stage, so any logline output inside
 * a Mats stage will have this set.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_TRACE_ID "traceId"}</b>: The Mats flow's traceId, set from the initiation.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_COMPLETE_PROCESS_RESULT "mats.exec.ProcessResult"}</b>: the ProcessResult enum</li>
 * </ul>
 * <b>Metrics for the processing of the stage</b> (very similar to the metrics for an initiation execution, but includes
 * the reception of a message):
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_COMPLETE_TIME_TOTAL_EXECUTION "mats.exec.TotalExecution.ms"}</b>: Total time taken for the
 * stage to complete - including both user code and all system code including commits.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_COMPLETE_TIME_TOTAL_PREPROC_AND_DESERIAL "mats.exec.TotalPreprocDeserial.ms"}</b>: Part of
 * the total time taken for the preprocessing and deserialization of the incoming message, same as the message received
 * logline's {@link #MDC_MATS_IN_TIME_TOTAL_PREPROC_AND_DESERIAL "mats.in.TotalPreprocDeserial.ms"}, as that piece is
 * also part of the stage processing.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_COMPLETE_TIME_USER_LAMBDA "mats.exec.UserLambda.ms"}</b>: Same as for initiation.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_COMPLETE_TIME_OUT "mats.exec.Out.ms"}</b>: Same as for initiation.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_COMPLETE_QUANTITY_OUT "mats.exec.Out.quantity"}</b>: Same as for initiation.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_COMPLETE_TIME_DB_COMMIT "mats.exec.DbCommit.ms"}</b>: Same as for initiation.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_COMPLETE_TIME_MSG_SYS_COMMIT "mats.exec.MsgSysCommit.ms"}</b>: Same as for initiation</li>
 * </ul>
 * <b>User metrics:</b> Furthermore, any metrics (measurements and timings) set from an initiation or stage will be
 * available as separate log lines - same as for initiations.<br/>
 *
 * <br/>
 * <h3>Extra Properties for Endpoint Complete:</h3> When any Stage of an Endpoint (typically the last) either REPLYs, or
 * stops the flow (neither sending a REQUEST, NEXT nor GOTO), the endpoint is completed.
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_ENDPOINT_COMPLETED "mats.EndpointCompleted"}</b>: 'true' on the same line as Stage Completed
 * if this also is the endpoint completion. Notice that the span from an initiation REQUEST to the replyTo-reception on
 * a Terminator is also counted as a EndpointCompleted.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_ENDPOINT_COMPLETE_TIME_TOTAL "mats.endpoint.Total.ms"}</b>: Time taken from entry on the
 * initial stage of an endpoint, to stage completed on the final stage (or from Initiation REQUEST to replyTo-reception
 * on the Terminator). <b>This metric is susceptible to time skews between nodes</b>.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Extra Properties for Flow Complete:</h3> When a Stage doesn't send any REPLY, REQUEST, NEXT or GOTO, it stops the
 * flow. This is the normal situation for a Terminator, but technically a flow may stop anywhere if the stage doesn't
 * send a flow message.
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_FLOW_COMPLETED "mats.FlowCompleted"}</b>: 'true' on the same line as Stage Completed if this
 * also is flow completion. <i>can be used to count mats flows</i>. This count has a very tight relationship with
 * {@link #MDC_MATS_INITIATE_COMPLETED}, read above.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_FLOW_COMPLETE_TIME_TOTAL "mats.flow.Total.ms"}</b>: Time taken from the flow was initiated at
 * a {@link MatsInitiator}, or from within a flow, to it ends. <b>This metric is susceptible to time skews between
 * nodes</b>.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br/>
 *
 *
 * <h2>MDC Properties for Per created Message (both initiations and stage produced messages):</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_MESSAGE_SENT "mats.MessageSent"}</b>: 'true' on single logline per sent message - <i>can be
 * used to count sent messages.</i></li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_DISPATCH_TYPE "mats.DispatchType"}</b>: The DispatchType enum; INIT, STAGE, STAGE_INIT</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_OUT_MATS_MESSAGE_ID "mats.out.MatsMsgId"}</b>: The messageId the Mats system gave the
 * message. Note that it consists of the Mats flow id + an individual part per message in the flow.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_OUT_MESSAGE_SYSTEM_ID "mats.out.MsgSysId"}</b>: The messageId that the messaging system gave
 * the message - for the JMS Implementation, it is the JMSMessageId.</li>
 * <li><i>NOTICE: NOT using "mats.out.from.app", as that is 'this' App, and thus identical to:
 * <code>"mats.AppName"</code>.</i></li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_OUT_FROM_ID "mats.out.from.Id"}</b>: "this" EndpointId/StageId/InitiatorId - <i>NOTICE:
 * <code>"mats.out.from.Id"</code> == <code>"mats.StageId"</code> for Stages - but there is no corresponding for
 * InitiatorId.</i></li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_OUT_TO_ID "mats.out.to.Id"}</b>: target EndpointId/StageId</li>
 * <li><i>NOTICE: NOT using "mats.out.to.app", since we do not know which app will consume it.</i></li>
 * </ul>
 * Common for all sent and received messages in a Mats flow (initiated, received on stage and sent from stage):
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_INIT_APP "mats.init.App"}</b>: Which App initiated this Mats flow.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_INIT_ID "mats.init.Id"}</b>: The initiatorId of this MatsFlow;
 * <code>matsInitiate.from(initiatorId)</code>.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_AUDIT "mats.Audit"}</b>: Whether this Mats flow should be audited.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_INTERACTIVE "mats.Interactive"}</b>: Whether this Mats flow should be treated as
 * "interactive", meaning that a human is actively waiting for its execution.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_PERSISTENT "mats.Persistent"}</b>: Whether the messaging system should use persistent (as
 * opposed to non-persistent) message passing, i.e. store to disk to survive a crash.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <b>Metrics for message production</b> (note how these compare to the reception of a message, on the "Message
 * Received" loglines):
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_OUT_TIME_TOTAL "mats.out.Total.ms"}</b>: Total time taken to produce the message, all of the
 * Mats envelope ("MatsTrace"), serializing, compressing and producing the message system message.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_OUT_TIME_ENVELOPE_PRODUCE "mats.out.EnvelopeProduce.ms"}</b>: Part of the total time taken to
 * produce the Mats envelope ("MatsTrace"), including serialization of all constituents: DTO, STO and any Trace
 * Properties.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_OUT_TIME_ENVELOPE_SERIAL "mats.out.EnvelopeSerial.ms"}</b>: Part of the total time taken to
 * serialize the Mats envelope.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_OUT_SIZE_ENVELOPE_SERIAL "mats.out.EnvelopeSerial.bytes"}</b>: Size of the serialized Mats
 * envelope.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_OUT_TIME_ENVELOPE_COMPRESS "mats.out.EnvelopeCompress.ms"}</b>: Part of the total time taken
 * to compress the serialized Mats envelope</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_OUT_SIZE_ENVELOPE_WIRE "mats.out.EnvelopeWire.bytes"}</b>: Size of the compressed serialized
 * Mats envelope.</li>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_OUT_TIME_MSGSYS "mats.out.MsgSys.ms"}</b>: Part of the total time taken to produce the
 * message system message.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <b>Note:</b> Both Initiation and Stage completed can produce messages. For the very common case where this is just a
 * single message (a single initiated message starting a Mats flow, or a REQUEST or REPLY message from a Stage (in a
 * flow)), the "Per message" log line is combined with the Initiation or Stage Complete log line - on the message part,
 * the two lines are separated by a "/n", while each of the properties that come with the respective log line either are
 * common - i.e. they have the same name, and would have the same value - or they are differently named, so that the
 * combination does not imply any "overwrite" of a property name. If you search for a property that only occurs on "Per
 * message" log lines (you e.g. want to count, or select, all outgoing message), you will get hits for log lines that
 * are in the "combined" form (e.g. initiation producing a single message), and for log lines for individual messages
 * (i.e. where an initiation produced two messages, which results in three log lines: 1 for the initiation, and 2 for
 * the messages).
 * <p />
 * <b>Note: This interceptor (SLF4J Logger with Metrics on MDC) has special support in <code>JmsMatsFactory</code>: If
 * present on the classpath, it is automatically installed using the {@link #install(MatsInterceptable)} install
 * method.</b> This interceptor implements the special marker-interface {@link MatsLoggingInterceptor} of which there
 * can only be one instance installed in a <code>JmsMatsFactory</code> - implying that if you want a different type of
 * logging, you may implement a custom variant (either subclassing this, on your own risk, or start from scratch), and
 * simply install it, leading to this instance being removed (or just not have this variant on the classpath).
